# The Brewmaster

The Brewmaster is a custom Slay the Spire character based on the tropes associated with the [Drunken Master](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster). A drunken fool, the Brewmaster has stumbled into the Spire and must use their variety of Brews and street fighting techniques to come out the other side.
## Mechanics & Themes
**Intoxication**: Certain cards will provide stacks of Intoxication. At 100 Intoxication, the Brewmaster will enter the Intoxicated Stance and unlock a set of bonus effects on certain cards. Some cards will even let you use Intoxication as a resource. However, the Brewmaster's metabolism works quickly, and you will lose 20% of your current Intoxication at the end of each turn.

**Brews**: The Brewmaster has a variety of mystical Brews that provide different effects on the battlefield. Use them to your advantage and make Dionysus proud.

**Drenched**: The Brewmaster soaks their enemies in liquor, creating a firey explosion that damages all enemies when ignited.

**Weakness**: A variety of cards add a new Status card, Woozy into you draw pile and discard pile. When drawn you will become Weakened. Some cards however, may reward you for being weaker than normal.
